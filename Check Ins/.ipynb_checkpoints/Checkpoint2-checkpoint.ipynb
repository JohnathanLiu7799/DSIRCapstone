    "    - I want to create models that predict which behaviours land a Team Fight Tactics player into higher positions.These behaviours would then be distiled down into easily interpretable labels for players to act on to increase their gameplay. End deliverable would also include an app ideally for easy application (put in summoner ID and return a series of tags and metrics to improve on).\n",

    "    -This product would appeal to tft players interested in improving their performance, eventually leading to monetization possibilities such as ads or a freemium model. Acquisition by a sites such as mobalytics or tftchess also a possibility. Success in this model would mean being able to predict a players placement given certain metrics, specifically points of imporovement.\n",
